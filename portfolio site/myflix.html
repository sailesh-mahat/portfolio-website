  <h2>  Overview: </h2>
  <p>MyFlix is a web-based single page app where users can log in and access information about
different movies, genres, and directors. Users can create an account and add or remove movies to
their list of favorites as well. Each user has a profile, with their information, and can be edited by
the users. Each user has a unique username and a password, which is entered during registration and
user authentication and authorization techniques has been implemented to allow access to users.
<h2>Purpose and Context: </h2>
<p>This project was my own, and done as a part of the CareerFoundry Course
on full-stack web development, during a span on 3 months, and my role was the sole full-stack
developer.</p>
<!--<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p> As a learning developer, my goal was to develop and improve my skills and build my
portfolio by completing a sophisticated project. With this project, I could exercise my front-end and
back-end skills as well as my skills on database and the business logic layer.</p>-->
<h2>Approach: </h2><p>The project started with the implementation of the server-side component of the app,
where I used different technologies like Node.js and Express. API endpoints were created and tested
in Postman. Then the API was deployed in Heroku. A non-relational database of different movies,
genres, directors, and users was created using MongoDB to display the movies in the app. After
server-side component was completed, I began working on the front-end or the client-side. I used
one of the famous javaScript libraries, ReactJS to build the front-end of the single page application. React Bootstrap was used to design the layout of the app as well. Finally, everything was deployed
to Heroku and the app was live.</p>

<h2>Challenge: </h2><p>The main challenge was to learn something entirely new and implement it to create
something within limited time. Some concepts were hard to grasp and some things could not be
implemented as desired, nevertheless it resulted in a functioning app.</p>
<!--<h2>Duration: </h2><p>The app took a bit more than the expected time. A time period of 2 months was the
desirable work period, but it took a whole extra month to get everything done.</p>-->
<h2>Final Showcase : </h2><p>The final app achieves all expectations, all functionalities are working well.
There are a few minor problems which are expected to be fixed in the next iteration of the app, such
as improving the overall design and the layout of the components. Some of them seem out of place
and as a result, the app is not turning out to be visually very appealing. Nevertheless, the hard-work
and the perseverance that was invested into successfully completing the project is something that
will always help me move forward as a web developer.</p>
